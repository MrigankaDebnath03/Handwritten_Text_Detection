# Handwritten Text Detection

This project is a handwritten text detection model built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) along with the CTC loss function to recognize handwritten text in an image.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the IAM Words dataset. The dataset can be downloaded using the following command:

```bash
!wget -q https://git.io/J0fjL -O IAM_Words.zip
!unzip -qq IAM_Words.zip
```

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of two main parts:

1. **Feature Extraction**: This part uses a simple architecture of two Convolutional layers and two MaxPooling layers to extract features from the images.

2. **Sequence Labelling**: This part uses two Bidirectional LSTM layers to label the sequence of features extracted by the CNNs.

The output of the network is passed through a CTC Layer to compute the CTC loss.

## Training

The model is trained for 20 epochs. To get good results, it is recommended to train the model for at least 50 epochs.

## Evaluation

The model uses the Edit Distance metric for evaluation. This metric calculates the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change the prediction into the target.

## Inference

The model uses greedy search to decode the output of the network. For complex tasks, beam search can be used.

## Saving the Model

The trained model can be saved as an H5 file using the following command:

```python
model.save('handwriting_recognizer.h5')
```

## Loading the Model

The saved model can be loaded using the following command:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
loaded_model = load_model('handwriting_recognizer.h5', compile=False)
```

## Future Work

- Train the model for more epochs to improve accuracy.
- Experiment with different model architectures and training strategies.
- Use data augmentation to increase the size of the training dataset.
